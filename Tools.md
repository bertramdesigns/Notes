## [Ratio Buddy](https://ratiobuddy.com/)
"RatioBuddy is a happy little tool to help you calculate aspect ratios."
This tool generates SCSS for you to copy and generates the appropriate inner and outer boxes. It adds the _padding-bottom_ calculation and all the correct other properties. 

Read the explanation about how this works [here](https://css-tricks.com/aspect-ratio-boxes/).
_**Tip**: Simply add `overflow: hidden;` to the outer and `object-fit: cover; object-position: center;` to an `<img>` to make an image that resizes and centers automatically to the ratio._

## [Wordpress Plugin Generator](https://wppb.me/)
